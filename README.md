Real time tweets, with moderation.

Over at the Student Life Media Team we encountered a situation where we needed the ability to track a hashtag but only display certain tweets to a wider audience.  This project aims to solve that problem.  Any user visiting /admin will be directed to an admin view by which they can see a list of tweets corresponding to a particular hashtag, updated in real time.

Users who visit / or /index will only see tweets as they get approved from someone who is sitting on /admin.

We're still in the process of refining some of the design pieces, but all the functionality is in place.
